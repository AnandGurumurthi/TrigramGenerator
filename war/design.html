			<div class="title">Trigram Generator - Design</div>
			<div class="content heading">Purpose of the project</div>
			<div class="content">
				The purpose of the project is to implement a
				n-gram generator. It takes the user input, processes the data and
				generates an n-gram. n-grams can be used to mutate text into new,
				surreal, forms.
			</div>
			<div class="content heading">High level design</div>
			<div class="content">
				This project is built using Spring MVC. We have
				a DispatcherServlet, that sends request to the mapped controllers.
				The controllers are injected with the Generator. The controller
				passes the user input to the Generator. The Generator passes it to
				the DataHandler which processes the data and forms the data structure
				based on the implementation defined. The Generator then does
				recursive loop and forms a new sentence based on the algorithm
				defined.
			</div>
			<div class="content heading">Benefits</div>
			<div class="content">
				1. The controller is designed to take a
				Generator interface. By leveraging the dependency injection of
				Spring, we can control the implementation of the n-gram algorithm. As
				a first step, the TrigramGenerator is used. The implementation can
				easily be changed by adding a new Generator as long as it follows the
				rules defined by the Generator interface.
			</div>
			<div class="content">
				2. A good approach for generating a n-gram is
				using the map data structure. The DataHandler interface is designed
				by keeping this in mind. The MapDataHandler is a basic implementation
				of the DataHandler interface by using a HashMap. If the need arises
				for handling larger data-sets or to achieve better performance, the
				program can be extended to use an in-memory database like memcached
				or Bekeley Database.
